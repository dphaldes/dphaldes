## Darshan Phaldesai / mystchonky / chonky

I am a very curious programmer who loves to learn new things. I love to break (working) things and enjoy building them back (which is why I absolutely love Neovim and my Linux machine :P ).

I am always learning new tech and programming languages. I am currently learning Graphics programming along with Rust and integrating into KDE/Kirigami stack!

### Projects:

I love FOSS and care alot about it! I am a contributor to many fantastic open source projects: - [Pixelorama](https://github.com/Orama-Interactive/Pixelorama) is an amazing Pixel Art drawing software made in Godot Engine - Minecraft Mods like [EnderIO](https://github.com/Team-EnderIO/EnderIO) and [Blood Magic](https://github.com/WayofTime/BloodMagic) (I have plenty of personal mods :) )

My (current) dream project is to build a fully extensible GUI frontend for Neovim
